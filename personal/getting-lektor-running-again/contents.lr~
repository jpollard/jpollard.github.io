I was listening to a podcast, and the guest was talking about how they used blogging to learn new topics. The premise was that if you teach something to solidify your understanding of it. I've got a few subjects that I'd like to start learning and thought the blog idea made sense. I've also been meaning to work on my writing. Thus, I've resurrected my github pages. The original site was built using Lektor to build static webpages. I'm in the process of getting that setup for blogging and other activities. I've got a vague notion of what I want to accomplish here, so I won't go into any specifics.
