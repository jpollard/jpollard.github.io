title: 0.0 100 Days of Learning
-------------------------------
body:
I'm a huge believer of continuing learning. I often find something I'm interested in learning but quickly give up learning it. I'm full of excuses why, too busy with work, not enough time at night, etc. Yet, I somehow find ways to spend hours on Youtube and multiple social media sites. Wasted hours.

I'm hoping to use this site as a foundation of my learning progress. I'm not limiting it to anything in particular. The sole premise is each subject will be limited to 100 days/posts. Not necessarily 100 consective days either, although hopefully most will be.

For the first 100 days, I'd like to focus on learning libGDX. I've always been interested in making games. I have several books on the subject that are half read, serveral projects half started, etc. The only game that I can say I've completed 100% is a number guessing game on my TI-82 in highschool.
